# EX-02-Cross-Platform-Prompting-Evaluating-Diverse-Techniques-in-AI-Powered-Text-Summarization

## AIM
To evaluate and compare the effectiveness of prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based) across different AI platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot) in a specific task: text summarization.

## Scenario:
You are part of a content curation team for an educational platform that delivers quick summaries of research papers to undergraduate students. Your task is to summarize a 500-word technical article on "The Basics of Blockchain Technology" using multiple AI platforms and prompting strategies.

Your goal is to determine which combination of prompting technique + platform provides the best summary in terms of:

Accuracy

Coherence

Simplicity

Speed

User experience

## Algorithm

# 1.Define Use Case
Identify a realistic personalization scenario (e.g., product recommendations based on user behavior).

# 2.Select Prompt Types
Choose three distinct prompting strategies:

Straightforward Prompt
Tabular Format Prompt
Missing Word Prompt

# 4.Design Prompts
Write specific prompt examples aligned with the use case for each strategy.

# 5.Submit to Platforms
Run each prompt through two different AI platforms (ChatGPT and Claude).

# 6.Collect Outputs
Record the responses generated by each platform.

# 7.Evaluate Criteria
Assess each output based on:

Relevance
Coherence
Customization Depth
Responsiveness
Tone

# 8.Compare and Recommend
Identify the best-performing combinations and suggest practical applications.

# Use Case
AI-Driven Personalization:
The system is designed to tailor product recommendations based on user preferences such as past purchases, browsing history, and selected interests.

 # 1. Straightforward Prompt
# Prompt:

"The user recently viewed fitness gear, bought a yoga mat, and added protein supplements to their cart. Suggest personalized product recommendations."

# Outputs
   # ChatGPT:

Based on your interest in fitness gear, you might like resistance bands, a foam roller, or a smart water bottle. We also suggest whey protein bars and a fitness tracker to complement your workout routine.

   # Claude:

Since you've been browsing fitness gear and purchased a yoga mat, we recommend items like resistance bands, kettlebells, or wellness supplements. A fitness smartwatch might also be helpful for your goals.
